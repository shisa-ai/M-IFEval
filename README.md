Instruction-Following Evaluation](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.04688)


Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in real-world applications that require understanding and executing user instructions accurately. Evaluating instruction following is crucial to ensure these models perform reliably across different tasks and languages.

Building upon the [Instruction Following Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911) benchmark, which first underscored the importance of instruction-following evaluation,  we introduce **M-IFEval**,  a benchmark designed to extend this evaluation to multiple languages.

M-IFEval currently supports **French**, **Japanese**, and **Spanish**, incorporating both general and language-specific instructions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual instruction adherence.

## ⚙️ How to run

### With Colab 🌐

We provide a Jupyter Notebook designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab. This notebook guides you through:

- Generating responses from models supported by Hugging Face (HF), OpenAI, and Anthropic.
- Evaluating a given model based on its generated responses.
- Displaying basic visualizations of evaluation results.

</a> 


### Locally :desktop_computer:

If you prefer to run the evaluation directly on your machine, whether for computational reasons or other preferences, follow these steps:

#### Setup Instructions
<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.01px #ddd; margin-top: 0;"/>

##### Clone the Repository  

First, clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/lightblue-tech/M-IFEval.git
```

Move into the cloned directory:
```bash
cd M-IFEval 
```

##### Install Dependencies  

Ensure all required Python packages are installed in your working environment:  

```bash
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Download Spacy models:

```bash
python -m spacy download es_core_news_sm --quiet
python -m spacy download xx_sent_ud_sm --quiet
```

#### Evaluate Your Model  
<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.01px #ddd; margin-top: 0;"/>

##### Prepare Responses File  

To evaluate your model, you need to create a JSONL file containing the instruction prompts and their corresponding responses.  

You can either manually create a file with the following structure:  

```json
{"prompt": "Write a 300+ word summary ...", "response": "PUT YOUR MODEL RESPONSE HERE"}
{"prompt": "I am planning a trip to ...", "response": "PUT YOUR MODEL RESPONSE HERE"}
```

Or, you can use `get_responses.py` to automatically generate the JSONL file in the required format:

- **For Hugging Face, OpenAI, or Anthropic models**:  

  To add support for a new model, update the `SUPPORTED_MODELS` dictionary in `get_responses.py` by specifying the model name and its corresponding inference method:  

  ```python
  SUPPORTED_MODELS = {
      "openai_model_name_or_version": "openai",
      "anthropic_model_name_or_version": "anthropic",
      "hf_model_name_or_path": "vllm"
  }
  ```  

  Replace `"openai_model_name_or_version"`, `"anthropic_model_name_or_version"`, or `"hf_model_name_or_path"` with the actual model identifiers.  

  **Note:** The dictionary values (`"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"vllm"`) must remain unchanged to ensure the correct inference method is used.  

  Once the model is added, generate responses by running:  
  
    ```bash
    python3 -m get_responses.py --model_name {model_name}
    ```  

  Replace `{model_name}` with the exact model identifier you added.

> [!NOTE] 
> Before running the scripts, make sure to set your API keys and Hugging Face token as environment variables. For OpenAI or Anthropic, set the API key like this:  
>
>```bash
>export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
>export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
>```
>
>For Hugging Face, set your token with:  
>
>```bash
>export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token_here"
>huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
>```
>
>Replace the placeholders with your actual keys. This will >ensure the scripts can access the necessary services.

- **For *(yet)* unsupported providers  requiring API keys**:  

  Implement a subclass of `ResponseGenerator` in `get_responses.py` to handle API calls for your provider.  

##### Run the Evaluation  

Once you have the JSONL file ready, run the evaluation script:  

```bash
python3 -m evaluation_main \
  --input_data=./data/{lang}_input_data.jsonl \
  --input_response_data=./data/input_response_data_model_name.jsonl \
  --output_dir=./evaluation/
```
- Replace `{lang}` with the language tag corresponding to the language you wish to evaluate (e.g., `en` for English, `fr` for French).
- Update `input_response_data` with the path to your model's response JSONL file.

This command will generate evaluation results in the specified output directory.
