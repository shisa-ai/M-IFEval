# Configuration for M-IFEval using Shisa v2 unphi4 14B.
# This config uses temperature 0.0 for deterministic output.

# Output configuration
output_dir: ./evaluation/

# Parallel processing
# Note: M-IFEval's get_responses.py uses this for vLLM server (ThreadPoolExecutor max_workers=15)
# This setting is for future use when shisa_run_eval.py supports parallel evaluation
workers: 15

# Model configuration
model:
  # Model name/path - Shisa v2 unphi4 14B (INT8 quantized)
  name: shisa-ai/shisa-v2-unphi4-14b-denoted-W8A8-INT8

  # Provider type - openai_compatible for OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
  provider: openai_compatible

  # Remote model identifier. When a model config omits remote_id, the loader
  # uses the model name. Most configs can skip this field.
  remote_id: null

  client:
    # Base URL for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Override per model if you
    # need to hit different services (e.g., local vs hosted variants).
    base_url: http://localhost:9000/v1

    # Environment variable supplying the API key. Leave unset for keyless local
    # endpoints, or override per model if a different credential is required.
    # Defaults to OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY
    api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY

    # Request timeout (seconds) for HTTP calls.
    # Note: Currently not used by M-IFEval but reserved for future use
    request_timeout: 60

  generation:
    # Temperature for sampling. Set to 0.0 for deterministic output.
    temperature: 0.0

    # Top-p for nucleus sampling
    top_p: 1.0

    # Reasoning effort level for models that support it (low, medium, high)
    # Set to null to omit the parameter for models that don't support it
    # Only supported by certain models like o1, o1-mini, and Gemini thinking models
